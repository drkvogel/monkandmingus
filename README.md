# Jazz - Where Monk and Mingus Live

"Jazz - Where Monk and Mingus Live" is a compilation of jazz music made for me by a friend, which features music by Roland Kirk, Miles Davis, Ginger Baker Trio, Buddy Rich - but oddly, nothing by Thelonius Monk or Charles Mingus!

The compilation was on a C90 [tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape) with no artwork, so I thought I'd create some artwork, download digital versions of the tracks, and recreate the compilation for the digital age.

"Where Monk and Mingus Live" is a [tune by Roland Kirk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxToj60raP8)
