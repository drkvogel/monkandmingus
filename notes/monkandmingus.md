# Jazz - Where Monk and Mingus Live

"Jazz - Where Monk and Mingus Live" is a compilation of jazz music made for me by a friend, which features music by Roland Kirk, Miles Davis, Ginger Baker Trio, Buddy Rich - but oddly, nothing by Thelonius Monk or Charles Mingus!

The compilation was on a C90 [tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape) with no artwork, so I thought I'd create some artwork and download digital versions of the tracks.

"Where Monk and Mingus Live" is a [tune by Roland Kirk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxToj60raP8)


## Artwork

The cover inspiration is the Blue Note-style atwork for the techno LP [The Blunted Boy Wonder](https://www.discogs.com/Steve-Stoll-The-Blunted-Boy-Wonder/master/63528) by [Steve Stoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Stoll_(musician)), which in turn is modelled on the [the sleeve](/artwork/dev/horaceparlan-speakin-my-piece-cover-1600.jpg) for the album [Speakin' My Piece](https://www.discogs.com/Horace-Parlan-Quintet-Speakin-My-Piece/release/2990828) by the [Horace Parlan Quintet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Parlan).

>Speakin' My Piece is an album by American jazz pianist Horace Parlan featuring performances recorded and released on the Blue Note label in 1960.
